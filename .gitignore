# Match all files that have no dot (.) in the filename

!*.*

# The two lines above work like this:
#   *      = match all files
#   *.     = only files with no extension (just ends with dot or no dot)
#   !*.*   = negate ignore for files that do have a dot

# You might also want to explicitly allow directories
